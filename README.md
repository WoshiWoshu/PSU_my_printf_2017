# PSU_my_printf_2017
First year C mini project in which the goal is to the re-code the printf fonction from the C library according to the C99 standard. It can process wide range of printf formating flags. %b formating flag is added, which prints unsigned numbers in a binary base and %S which is basically the same as %s.
